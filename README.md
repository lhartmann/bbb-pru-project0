# bbb-pru-project0

An attempt to ease the development of realtime programs for the PRU of the BeagleBone Black.
PRÃ‰-ALPHA, buggy and incomplete.

Objectives:

- Provide similar coding style to other Texas Instruments DSPs, such as TMS320F28335.
- Allow building on the beaglebone itself, using TI's official PRU compiler.
- Just "make" it and it should be ready.
